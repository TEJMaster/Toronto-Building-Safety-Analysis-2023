## Building Integrity in Retrospect: Assessing the Impact of Age on 2023 Safety Evaluations
This repository hosts the project "Building Integrity in Retrospect: Assessing the Impact of Age on 2023 Safety Evaluations," which investigates the impact of building age on their safety evaluations. This research utilizes data from the Toronto Open Data portal, analyzing 3,435 records of apartment evaluations to explore the relationship between the year of construction and the current safety scores assigned. The study aims to determine how the age of a building affects its perceived integrity and compliance with modern safety standards, especially in the context of Toronto's diverse urban landscape.

Throughout this project, insights gleaned from the data are expected to inform policy recommendations and contribute to the discourse on urban development and maintenance. In addition, this research effort leverages advanced statistical techniques, including simple linear regression, to forecast and interpret the potential trajectory of building evaluations.

### Repository Structure
To facilitate transparency and reproducibility, the repository is structured as follows:

- `inputs/data/`: Contains the raw dataset, building_evaluation_data.csv, obtained from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal.
- `outputs/`: Hosts all generated outputs and findings from the project:
- `outputs/data/`: Houses the processed and cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
- `outputs/paper/`: Stores the comprehensive report detailing our findings and implications.
- `scripts/`: Consists of R scripts utilized for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

### How to Use This Repository

- **Data Analysis Workflow**: For an in-depth analysis process, refer to the R markdown files within the scripts/ directory.
- **Reading the Report**: The full report, including insights and policy implications, can be found under outputs/report/.
- **Exploring Data**: Access the initial dataset in inputs/data/ and the cleaned data in outputs/data/.
